# Notes on the intersection of AI and blockchain

## AI enhancing blockchain

- Automated smart contract auditing (both static n dynamic analysis)
- Economic simulations
- Chain recommendation?
- Smart contract assist?
- Analytics in general, searching for signal in blockchain activity
- Understanding of the trilemma and coming up with protocols that are provably superior (since AI has already been used for math proofs)

## Blockchain enhancing AI
- Cryptographic research itself leads to techniques that can help AI be more private (eg homomorphic encryption)
- Distributed systems research in blockchains can potentially teach AI practitioners how to better perform distributed training of models

## Challenges of integrating the two
- AI models and data sets tend to be large and thus expensive to store/ run on blockchain
